## What is this?
These are exercises drawn from or inspired by those in the [Pi Educational Manual](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf) by written by members of [Computing at School](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk).  

## Usage
You can `git clone` these files individually or the whole repo.  We suggest using the whole repo if you're teaching a course, even if you only do a few of the assignments in class.  You'll find a corresponding page and version number (currently Manual v 1.0) commented in the code of those that have mention in the Manual. 

Many have been adapted and tested to be compatable with Python 2.7 (and are likely compatible with any Python 2); you'll see a '2x' added to the end of these filenames. Be sure to use these if you're running Python 2x You can check which version you have by running
    $ python --version


## Status
As of February 2013 this has all of the Python exercises in the coding manual. Check Issues tagged 'manual' to see which have been tested with Python 2x.
