## This is only the beginning – where do we go from here? 
These experiments may have left you exhausted and slightly confused, but 
I hope that they have also whetted your appetite to learn more about 
computer programming, computer science and computing in general. This is only 
the beginning.

This isn’t a reference manual or a tutorial but the Python language comes with a 
comprehensive reference guide. If you don’t have access to the internet, you can 
access the guide by typing:
```
 $ pydoc -g &
```
Select “open browser” from the dialogue box that appears. This may take 20 
seconds to appear, so be patient. From here, you can see all the Python 
documentation, PyGame and numpy.

If you do have access to the internet, there are plenty of resources covering how 
to program using Python. Now you have a skill for entering code, running code 
and hopefully toying with it, you can find out much more here:
* [Beginner’s reading](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
* [Learning with Python](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/)
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/)
* [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)

When you are stuck you can try the main source of all knowledge (for Python). 
For instance, information about str, chr, file, random, math, PySide, and heapq 
can be found at:
* [Python Library Reference](http://docs.python.org/library/)
* [PySide](http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/)
* [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org)
* [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org)

For information about print, while, yield, for, break, pass look at:
* [Python Language Reference](http://docs.python.org/reference/)
