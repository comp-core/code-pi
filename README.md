code-pi
=======

The tastiest introduction to coding on the web.

This repo is for code and course material to teach coding using a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).  It is inteneded as a free, collaborative educational resource for instructors, students, and hackademics.  Help us make it the best intro to coding on the web!

```python
   def code-pi(our_ideas, your_contributions)
      # A global community...
      global collaboration
      global knowledge  
      
      # ...working together...
      collaboration = our_ideas + your_contributions
      knowledge = collaboration
      
      # ...to teach the world to code!
      return knowledge  
```

## Under Construction
This repo is under construction but will be ready for teaching in the Summer and Fall of 2013.  During this period of intensive development it's best to fork if you'd like static materials (i.e. a static link for your students to `git clone`).  Stay tuned or see the section on contributing below!

## Resources
There are several great resources out there for teaching coding on the Pi.  While this repo is under construction, check these out:
* [Pi Education Manual](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2965) ([PDF here](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf)) - An excellent and broad intro into what you can do with the Pi.  code-pi contains a transcription of much of the code from the Python section.
* [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/) - A free book focused on learning through game creation. Many/most of the Python games that come with the Pi were written by the book's author, Al Sweigart.
* [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) - A Python textbook available as a free e-book or in hard copy from Amazon.  See also [our fork](http://github.com/comp-core/Think-Python) of the author's code repo going along with the book.  We'll be editing and improving the usability of the repo.

This is only a partial list.  Think you've got more good links?  Contribute them!
